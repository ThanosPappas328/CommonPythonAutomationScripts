# 🛠️ Common Python Automation Scripts

A personal collection of Python scripts that automate small, repetitive tasks—saving time, clicks, and sanity.

## 📜 What’s Inside

| Script | Description |

| `video_downloader.py` | Download videos from a given URL (YouTube etc.) |
| `file_scraper.py` | Scrape and download files from provided URLs |
| `text_cleaner.py` | Clean and format raw text files (e.g., remove symbols, standardize spacing) |
| `screenshot_organizer.py` | Organize screenshots into folders by date |
| `bulk_renamer.py` | Rename a batch of files in a customizable format |

## 🧰 Tech Used

- Python 3
- `requests`, `os`, `re`, `yt-dlp`, `BeautifulSoup`
- Terminal-friendly utilities

## 🚀 How to Use

Clone the repo and run any script directly:

```bash
python video_downloader.py

Make sure to read any comments or config requirements at the top of each script.

🤔 Why I Built This
These scripts solve everyday problems I ran into—like downloading a lecture video, organizing messy screenshots, or scraping reference PDFs.
Instead of doing things manually, I automated them. ✨
